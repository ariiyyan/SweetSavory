Sweet And Savoryâœ©
You're hosting an event at a food festival and want to showcase the best possible pairing of two dishes from the festival that complement each other's flavor profile.
Each dish has a flavor profile represented by an integer. A negative integer means a dish is sweet, while a positive integer means a dish is savory. The absolute value of that integer represents the intensity of that flavor. For example, a flavor profile of -3 is slightly sweet, one of -10 is extremely sweet, one of 2 is mildly savory, and one of 8 is significantly savory.
You're given an array of these dishes and a target combined flavor profile. Write a function that returns
